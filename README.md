# Analyzing-and-Forecasting-Temperature-Variations-with-the-ARIMA-Model
The ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used in this study to predict and anticipate average temperature changes in five countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Kenya, and India. 

INTRODUCTION
-------
This study gives a detailed examination and proves the ARIMA model's effectiveness in forecasting temperature trends across these disparate geographical regions. The study's major goal is to demonstrate the ARIMA model's relevance and effectiveness in predicting climatic trends, particularly in the context of average temperature measurements, in the aforementioned nations.

# RESULT AND DISCUSSION
-------
A.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-------

The first stage of this research entailed completing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a vital step in comprehensive data analytics, to get a better knowledge of the dataset and inform subsequent decision-making. The dataset was geographically restricted to temperature data from five nations from 1900 to 2015: the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Kenya, and India. During this procedure, we discovered four missing values in the filtered dataset, which we then eliminated. Because of its minor influence, this exclusion was judged insignificant to the overall analytical results.

B.	Model Application
-------
The ARIMA model is technically represented as ARIMA(p, d, q), where 'p' and 'q' are non-negative integers denoting the order of the autoregressive and moving average components, respectively. The parameter 'd' represents the model's needed order of differencing, which is an important component that tackles the stationarity of the time series data [6]. This notation captures the ARIMA model's structural features, reflecting its underlying mathematical and statistical foundation.

C.	Result
------
Using techniques such as Autocorrelation, Differencing, and Partial Autocorrelation, an ARIMA model configuration of (2,1,3) was developed and deployed to a training dataset covering the years 1900 to 2010. This model setup performed well, as seen by a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) number, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. Figure 2 depicts the resultant plot, which depicts the model's prediction accuracy versus the actual data.

D. Discussion.
------
The ARIMA model's effectiveness was highly dependent on the individual meteorological features of each location under examination. The results show that the model's performance was within an acceptable range, as shown by low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. This indicates a notable degree of precision in the model's prediction skills, which have been adapted to the different climatic circumstances of the respective locations.

# CONCLUSION/ FUTURE RECOMMENDATION

A.	Conclusion
------
The ARIMA model's effectiveness was highly dependent on the individual meteorological features of each location under examination. The results show that the model's performance was within an acceptable range, as shown by low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. This indicates a notable degree of precision in the model's prediction skills, which has been adapted to the different climatic circumstances of the respective locations.

B.	Future Recommendation
------
Following research may focus on improving the ARIMA model by including new predictive components like as greenhouse gas emissions and solar activity, as suggested by [7]. To improve prediction precision, a more sophisticated approach to parameter optimisation inside the ARIMA framework may be advantageous. Furthermore, the incorporation of exogenous factors or the use of more sophisticated models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, might be investigated to improve the accuracy of climate forecasts.
